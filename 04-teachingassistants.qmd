# Teaching Assistants

Most of this year's stellar group of teaching assistants have been in your shoes - they've taken the course in the past, and they enjoyed it enough to come back for more. They are volunteering their precious time and energy to help make the course happen, and we couldn't be more delighted to welcome you to the course. All office hours and all teaching assistant work will be done remotely.

There is a lot to learn in this class. Don't suffer in silence - talk to us! As mentioned earlier, **you shouldn't spend more than 15 minutes struggling with anything in this class without asking for help.**

Visit the [Getting Help with 432](05-gettinghelp.qmd) section of this Syllabus for more details.

The Spring 2023 Teaching Assistants for 432 are:

- [Stephanie Merlino Barr][Stephanie Merlino Barr], PhD candidate in Clinical Translational Science
- [Shiying Liu][Shiying Liu], PhD candidate in Epidemiology \& Biostatistics
- [Ali Elsharkawi][Ali Elsharkawi], MS student in Clinical Research

## TA office hours

TA office hours are held via Zoom, will begin in January and end in May. The weekly schedule will appear on our [Contact Us page](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2023/contact.html) as well as in our [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2023/calendar.html).

- Our Shared Google Drive (432 Spring 2023 Dr Love and Students) will contain Zoom links for each of these sessions in a document called **TA office hours schedule and Zoom links**. 
  - No appointment is necessary. Please just drop in. 
  - Be sure to log into Google via CWRU to access the shared Drive.
- TA office hours are cancelled during Spring Break.

Professor Love will also hold "office hours" before and after each class to the extent possible.

Stephanie’s research focuses on the relationship of early life nutrition interventions and long-term growth and developmental outcomes in very low birthweight infants. Outside of work & PhD life, Stephanie spends her time running, gardening, and hanging out with her dog.

#### Shiying Liu {-}

```{r Shiying_fig, echo = FALSE, out.width = '20%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Shiying_Liu.jpg")
```

Shiying Liu is a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in Epidemiology and Biostatistics within the Department of Population & Quantitative Health Sciences. Shiying completed her undergraduate study focusing on biological sciences at Fudan University back in China and then received her master's degree in biomedical engineering from Carnegie Mellon University. She took 431/432 in 2019/2020, which was of great help for her research projects and the preparations for the comprehensive exam. Currently, her research focus broadly addresses the critical gaps in knowledge of how information is encoded into DNA and how the story, when changed, leads to human disease using emerging statistical and bioinformatic approaches. Outside of research, she is a foodie and a superfan of detective fiction. Always passionate to solve the puzzle, "the truth is always curious and beautiful to seekers after it."
